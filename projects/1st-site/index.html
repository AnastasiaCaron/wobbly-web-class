    <p style="color:aquamarine; background:black;"><em>Traditionally</em>, Western playing cards are made of rectangular layers of paper or thin cardboard pasted together to form a flat, semirigid material. <strong>They are uniform in shape and size and small enough for several to be held together in one hand </strong>, frequently fanned out so that the identifying marks on each card can be seen. One side of each card—its front, or face—is marked so as to render it identifiable and distinguishable from its fellows, while the back, or reverse, is either blank or bears a pattern common to all. <br>The corners are usually slightly rounded to prevent fraying. In the second half of the 20th century, it became common to add a plastic coating to resist wear and even to produce all-plastic cards. </p>
