      <p>Anastasia Caron is a newly minted illustrator with a love for stories and a knack for orchestrating fantastical moments in limbo that reflect complex moods.</p>

      <p>She’s about to graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University with a BFA in Communications Arts (a confusing name for a wide illustration major), and a business minor (so much less confusing).  Her 1st ever job was as a self employed face painter at farmers markets with her 10 year-old sister.  Since then she has gained proficiency in digital drawing (adobe suite, clip studio paint), watercolor, 2D animation, 3D modeling, typography and a little HTML and CCS coding, and has made the dean’s list every semester at VCU.</p>

      <p>Anastasia is the oldest of 4, with a deep love for her family and small cities in the mountains, and a dungeons and dragons nerd.</p>
