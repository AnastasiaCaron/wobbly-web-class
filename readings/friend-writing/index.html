  <h1>I only have thoughts for this website</h1>

  <p>Ummmmm, it's a cool website, neat concept with introspective, ironic things to say.  </p>
  <p>But it's very overwhelming.  I assume that's kind of the point, but I've tried opening it and reading it multiple times, and I just gotta bail pretty quickly because of how much it stresses me out.</p>
  <p>Very cool idea and way of execution.  I can see that  a lot of time was poured into it.</p>
