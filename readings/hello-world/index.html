  <h3>1st comment written out - legibly and more eliquently:</h3>

  <p>I love the aestetic of simple water color paintings drawn right on the website.  It really emphasizes the handmade and child-like-curousity in approaching something new, giving an intresting tone and perspective as this person explains their experenice of building a computer and getting to know the internet.<br></p>

  <p>Intresting the metaphors he makes between art and how a computer works.  I wasn't expecting another reason for the half painted website.
